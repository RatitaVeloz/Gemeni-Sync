# Fix Mobile Carousel Responsiveness

The goal is to ensure the carousel displays a single slide effectively occupying 100% width on mobile devices (screen width <= 767px), fixing the issue where multiple or partial slides are shown.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To apply this fix to the specific carousel, you will need to add the CSS class `mobile-carousel-fix` to the carousel widget's settings in Elementor (Advanced > Layout > CSS Classes).

## Proposed Changes

### Theme CSS
#### [MODIFY] [style.css](file:///c:/xampp/htdocs/beatwines/wp-content/themes/hello-elementor-child/style.css)
- Add a media query for `max-width: 767px`.
- Inside, define `.mobile-carousel-fix .swiper-slide` to have `width: 100% !important` and `flex-basis: 100% !important`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  Agent submits the CSS changes.
2.  **User Action**: User adds the class `mobile-carousel-fix` to the Carousel widget in Elementor Editor.
3.  User saves and views the page on a mobile device (or creates a browser recording/screenshot simulating mobile width).
4.  Confirm that only one slide is visible at a time.
